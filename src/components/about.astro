        This is some jibberish that Gerald loves to write. No really, he does.
        He did it for the UK guys too. There really is no telling how many
        paragraphs he can fill here, but if he can fill just the one that would
        already be great. As you might be able to tell Iâ€™m waffling a great deal
        to fill this paragraph myself, but we do need to make sure that it is
        replaced at some point. Really.
